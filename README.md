### user research protocol

##### the target audience you hope to reach with your story:

The target audiences including normal students and some student who interested in tennis. For the audiences, I just send all of them the questionnaires and let them reply me. 

##### My interview questions:

•	Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?
•	Assuming the content is complete and accurate, does the content (visualizations/text) support its title?
•	Does the storyline flow smoothly? Is there is a problem with the arrangement?
•	Do you think the selection logic is smoothly?
•	Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough?
•	Do you have any recommendation to improve?
•	Is there any additional information you would like to know?

##### The finding:

Basically, all of interviewees are understanding the research is about, and some of them feel the research is quite interesting, especially the students who are interested in tennis. And most of them understand my logic to select the best player in history. Some of them feel confused why I do not just use one standard to select the top player. After I explained to her, she got point and reckon the approach is fine. 

Besides, some of them think even the method is fine, I still need to be clear in the title that it is my standard to select the player. Thus, I will change the title a little bit.

Then, Some of them did not understand what is "basic statistics", I will explain it in the final version. 

Finally, some of them think the text have some grammar mistakes, I will also fix it in my final version. 

##### The change:

I will change the title a to “ who is the tennis GOAT for my standard”. Besides I will change the text titles in the all the three subtitle so that the audience can understand them clearly, for the second part, I will square the top three players so that the audience can know who are the three players for next round selection.
